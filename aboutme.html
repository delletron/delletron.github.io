		<h1>you feels me?</h1>
		<p> I am not lost, but I am a slow wanderer. I follow dimly lit sprites to exciting and boring new days.</p>
		<p> I like creating things, which one of the main reasons why I came to GA. Being able to see the process of a website from design and concept to completetion is something I would take pride in. </p>
